📖 (ch-2) **Datatype, Constant & Variable:**<br/>
🔢 (Task-5) Write a program to perform all arithmetic operators such as +, -, *, /, and %.<br/>

🎉 **Output:**
Addition of 12 and 6 is 18<br/>
Subtraction of 12 and 6 is 6<br/>
Multiplication of 12 and 6 is 72<br/>
Division of 12 and 6 is 2<br/>
Modulo of 12 and 6 is 0<br/>

12 + 6 = 18<br/>
12 - 6 = 6<br/>
12 * 6 = 72<br/>
12 / 6 = 2<br/>
12 % 6 = 0<br/>
